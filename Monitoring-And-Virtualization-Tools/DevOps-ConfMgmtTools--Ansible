Running Ansible
===============

1. Go to /etc/ansible/hosts file and add node1 private ip

Run all below commands from controller only

1. Verify ping works by ansible

ansible node1 -m ping					- It should return success

2. Go to /etc/ansible/hosts file and add node1 under [webservers]

e.g. [webservers]
	  1.2.3.4
ansible webservers -m ping

3. Create your own inventory file and use it

Create file /etc/ansible/inventory and add entry as below
[web]
node1

ansible web -i /etc/ansible/inventory -m ping

add node1 entry again in /etc/ansible/hosts file if missing

4. Running ad-hoc command

ansible node1 -m copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/tmp"				- Verify file gets copied in /tmp on node1
ansible node1 -m yum -a "name=httpd state=absent"				- Verify httpd gets removed
ansible node1 -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present"				- Verify httpd gets installed
ansible node1 -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"			- Verify httpd service gets started

ansible node1 -m yum -a "name=httpd state=absent"				- Verify httpd gets removed

5. Ansible playbook

Create file httpd.yml with below content

---
- name: Installing httpd
  hosts: node1
  remote_user: root 

  tasks:
  - name: HTTPD installation
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present 

  - name: Start the service 
    service:
      name: httpd
