	   2. If you are using AWS EC2 AMI for docker volume labs, then please run below command to stop HTTPD server which is running on 80 port

*** DOCKER VOLUME ***
=====================

docker container run -dt --name mydemo nginx
docker ps
cd /var/lib/docker/overlay2
ls -lrt 							- Verify number of directories
docker container stop mydemo
docker container rm mydemo

ls -lrt 							- Verify one/two directories gets deleted. i.e. Container writable layer

docker volume ls
docker volume create demovolume
docker volume ls

docker container run -dt --name mydemo -v demovolume:/var nginx 
docker ps
docker volume inspect demovolume
cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/demovolume/_data   		- Verify files and directories

ls -lrt
docker container exec -it mydemo bash
cd /var
ls -lrt 											- Verify files and directories. Data should be same as above, as /var is mounted
exit

docker container stop mydemo
docker container rm mydemo
docker ps -a

cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/demovolume/_data   		- Verify files and directories are not deleted with container deletion
ls -lrt

docker volume rm demovolume
ls -lrt /var/lib/docker/volumes/          			- Verify files and directories deleted with volume deletion
